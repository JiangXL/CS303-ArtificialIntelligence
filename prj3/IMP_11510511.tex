\section{Preliminaries}

The conceptually simplest model of this type is what one could call the
$Independent Cascade Model$, investigated recently in the context of
marketing by reports. We again start with an initial set of active nodes
$A_0$, and the process unfolds in discrete steps according to the
following randomized rule. When node $v$ first becomes active in step $t$
,it is given a single chance to activate each currently inactive
neighbor $w$; it succeeds with a probability $p_{v,w}$ --- a parameter of
the system --- independently of the history thus far. (If $w$ has multiple
newly activated neighbors, their attempts are sequenced in an arbitray 
order.) If $v$ succeeds, then $w$ will become active in step $t+1$; but
whether or not $v$ succeeds, then it cannnot make any further attempts
to activate $w$ in subsequent rounds. Again, the process runs until no
more activations are possible.
